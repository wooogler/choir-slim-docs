# Lab Introduction #
The Smart Life in Motion (SLIM) Lab at Virginia Tech investigates how human functional capabilities vary under diverse environmental demands and seeks to promote inclusive, healthy mobility across populations. At its core, SLIM Lab is committed to two overarching goals:

Assess human motion by integrating functional biomechanics, wearable sensing, and data analytics across varied real-world contexts.

Enhance human performance and well-being through the design of timely, evidence-based interventions tailored to diverse individuals and environments 

SLIM Lab’s work addresses a critical challenge: neglecting human diversity in design increases work-related injuries and creates barriers to access for vulnerable populations—such as those with mobility impairments—limiting their access to essential environments and services like public transportation
