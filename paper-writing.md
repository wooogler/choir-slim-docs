# Co-Author Communication Responsibilities

- First authors are responsible for informing their co-authors about the results of submitted abstracts or manuscripts. This includes emailing them the results, attaching the review report, and clearly stating whether the abstract was rejected, accepted as a poster, or accepted as a lecture. Additionally, first authors should inform co-authors about their next steps, such as reviewing the final abstract or extended abstract. This responsibility applies to all other publications as well.
