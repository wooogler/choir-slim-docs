## Target Venues

SLIM Lab focuses on occupational ergonomics, wearable sensors, and human-technology interaction in both physical and virtual environments (e.g., VR training, motion feedback, lifting analysis), and targets journals in the HCI field.

The lab frequently publishes in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals in ergonomics, human factors, occupational safety, and the HCI field.

### Core Journals

- **Applied Ergonomics** (Elsevier) — Primary journal for empirical ergonomics studies.
- **Ergonomics** (Taylor & Francis) — Regular outlet for work on human performance and posture.
- **International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics** (Elsevier) — For workplace and equipment-focused studies.
- **Human Factors** (SAGE) — Prestigious journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES)
- **IISE Transactions on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors** — Applied industrial ergonomics

The lab consistently presents at leading ergonomics and human factors conferences:

### Target Conferences

- **Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) Annual Meeting**
- The SLIM Lab at Virginia Tech has a preference for targeting specific conferences that align with its research goals and objectives, with HFES being a more preferred venue over others.
- This preference suggests that HFES aligns well with the lab's focus on human motion, functional biomechanics, and the integration of wearable sensing and data analytics.
- Attending HFES likely provides valuable opportunities for SLIM Lab to engage with relevant research communities, share findings, and collaborate on projects that promote inclusive and healthy mobility.
- **Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE)**

# Co-Author Communication Responsibilities

- First authors are responsible for informing their co-authors about the results of submitted abstracts or manuscripts. This includes emailing them the results, attaching the review report, and clearly stating whether the abstract was rejected, accepted as a poster, or accepted as a lecture. Additionally, first authors should inform co-authors about their next steps, such as reviewing the final abstract or extended abstract. This responsibility applies to all other publications as well.
