## Target Venues

SLIM Lab focuses on occupational ergonomics, wearable sensors, and human-technology interaction in both physical and virtual environments (e.g., VR training, motion feedback, lifting analysis), and targets journals in the HCI field.

The lab frequently publishes in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals in ergonomics, human factors, occupational safety, and the HCI field.

### Core Journals

- **Applied Ergonomics** (Elsevier) — Primary journal for empirical ergonomics studies.
- **Ergonomics** (Taylor & Francis) — Regular outlet for work on human performance and posture.
- **International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics** (Elsevier) — For workplace and equipment-focused studies.
- **Human Factors** (SAGE) — Prestigious journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES)
- **IISE Transactions on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors** — Applied industrial ergonomics

The lab consistently presents at leading ergonomics and human factors conferences:

### Target Conferences

- **Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) Annual Meeting**
- HFES is the most preferred conference.
- **Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE)**
- The Smart Life in Motion (SLIM) Lab at Virginia Tech considers the Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE) conference as the most preferred conference for their work. This preference suggests that the conference aligns well with the lab's focus on human motion, functional biomechanics, wearable sensing, and data analytics, as well as their commitment to enhancing human performance and well-being. Attending AHFE may provide valuable opportunities for SLIM Lab to share research findings, collaborate with other experts in the field, and stay updated on the latest advancements relevant to their goals of promoting inclusive and healthy mobility.

# Co-Author Communication Responsibilities

- First authors are responsible for informing their co-authors about the results of submitted abstracts or manuscripts. This includes emailing them the results, attaching the review report, and clearly stating whether the abstract was rejected, accepted as a poster, or accepted as a lecture. Additionally, first authors should inform co-authors about their next steps, such as reviewing the final abstract or extended abstract. This responsibility applies to all other publications as well.
