# 🔬 SLIM Lab Research Handbook

## 🧭 Mission Statement

The SLIM Lab is dedicated to advancing inclusive and safe human-centered design through a deep understanding of human motion, performance, and well-being. Our mission is to assess and support diverse human functional capabilities—especially in demanding or restrictive environments—by integrating biomechanics, wearable sensing, and data analytics.

## 🎯 Research Goals

- **Assess Human Motion**Combine functional biomechanics, wearable sensing technologies, and data analytics to measure human movement in real-world and controlled environmental contexts.
- **Enhance Human Performance and Well-being**Improve human functioning by delivering timely, personalized, and context-aware interventions—especially in occupational and public environments.

## 🧑‍🔬 Human-subject Study and IRB

This section contains information about human subject study and IRB information. As part of our lab, all new students should complete the CITI training to be compliant with the IRB process. I am listing the instructions to complete your CITI certification.

- Open an account here with your VT ID: https://www.citiprogram.org/?pageID=668

Select "login with your organization". Search for Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

- Complete these courses with a passing mark and download the completion certificates. You will need those certificates for the IRB website.

List of courses to be completed:

- Basic Responsible Conduct of Research Course
