# Introduction

The Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) offers a broad-based program allowing students to pursue graduate study commensurate with their career goals. Specific strengths of the program are in the areas of human factors engineering and ergonomics, general industrial engineering, management systems engineering, manufacturing systems engineering, operations research, engineering administration, and systems engineering. The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is offered in Industrial and Systems Engineering, as is the Master of Science (M.S.) and Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), and Master of Engineering Administration (M.E.A.). The department also offers a Master of Science (M.S.) in Systems Engineering (M.S.)

# GRADUATE PROGRAM POLICIES & PROCEDURES

## 1. Purpose of the Graduate Manual

This graduate manual provides requirements, policies, and procedures adopted by the faculty for current graduate students in industrial and systems engineering (ISE) for successful completion of graduate degrees. Students should be aware that the requirements provided here represent minimum requirements for ISE. It is imperative that you consult your advisor before taking classes since the ultimate approval for your course selection rests with the faculty. Additional information concerning graduate school requirements may be found in the Graduate Policies and Procedures and Course Catalog from Virginia Tech. http://graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_catalog/

If there is any doubt regarding the interpretation of any regulation or requirement in this manual, or if there are questions about the graduate program involving matters not covered in this manual, please consult the ISE Graduate Program Director, Dr. Maury A. Nussbaum, or the ISE Graduate Program Advisor, Hannah Parks. It is each individual student’s responsibility to be familiar with all university policies, procedures, and requirements.

The provisions of this manual do not constitute a contract, expressed or implied, between any applicant or student and the ISE Department or Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The university and the ISE Department reserve the right to change any of the provisions, schedules, programs., courses, rules, regulations, or fees whenever university or departmental authorities deem it expedient to do so.

## 2. Administration of ISE Graduate Program

The graduate program is administered by the Graduate Policy Committee (GPC), which is also charged with the responsibility for resolving conflicts that may arise regarding policy or procedural issues. The director of the ISE graduate program chairs the GPC. In addition to chairing the GPC, the director of the graduate program is responsible for implementation of requirements, policies, and procedures adopted by the ISE faculty. The director of the graduate program and members of the GPC are appointed by the ISE department head. The ISE Graduate Admissions Committee (GAC) makes all admission decisions. The GAC also assigns incoming graduate students to a temporary advisor in their primary interest area.

## 3. Financial Assistance

The ISE Department has limited financial assistance available for qualified graduate students in the form of graduate teaching assistantships (GTA) and graduate research assistantships (GRA). Grado, Pratt, NIOSH, Davenport, and Cunningham Fellowships are also available through the ISE department, college of engineering and the Graduate School. The monthly stipend for GTAs and GRAs varies depending on the nature of the assistantship and the graduate level of the student. All assistantships carry a waiver of tuition, except those awarded during summer terms. The student is responsible for comprehensive and other fees (visit http://www.bursar.vt.edu for current fees).

All financial assistance is awarded on a competitive basis, with awards being made to the most qualified students based on merit. GTAs are awarded by the GPC and specific course assignments are made by departmental administration based on teaching needs. A student who is awarded a full-time GTA is obligated for 20 hours of work per week throughout the semester for which the award applies. Typically, a GTA is assigned to a member of the ISE faculty to assist in teaching a course. GRA awards are made to support research projects that are supervised by ISE faculty. Hence, the principal investigator for the research project from which the funding comes awards the GRA. A student receiving a GRA is expected to work 20 hours per week during the semester for which the award applies, the duties being assigned by the principal investigator. In a similar manner, the duties of a student on a fellowship depend on the particular fellowship and are not covered in this manual.

Students holding a full GTA or GRA must carry a course load of at least 12 credit hours per semester, and not more than 18 hours. Students holding less than full GTAs or GRAs receive a proportionally smaller stipend and reduced tuition waiver and carry a proportionally lower workload. However, all students on assistantship must be registered for a minimum of 12 hours per semester.

Graduate Research Assistant (GRA). Graduate research assistants are graduate students conducting academically significant research under the direction of a regular faculty member, who is generally a principal investigator on an external grant or contract.

Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA). Graduate teaching assistants may assist faculty in teaching lower division courses, including laboratory teaching assignments, or in providing other appropriate professional assistance. First year GTAs with no prior teaching experience will not be assigned full responsibility for lecture courses. In ISE, it is unusual for a GTA to be assigned full course responsibility.

## 4. Awarding of Graduate Teaching Assistantships

GTA support depends on the number of positions available and the number of applications for these positions. Graduate student applications for GTA support are invited from continuing Ph.D. students when they submit their annual Student Activity Reports (in January or February). The ISE Graduate Policy Committee reviews these applications and awards GTAs based on the following criteria: a) degree program (Ph.D. students have higher priority than M.S. students); b) academic performance (e.g., GPA), progress (completing program milestones), and productivity (e.g., journal and conference papers); and c) performance of prior GTA duties (if applicable). Ph.D. students who have had GTA support for eight or more academic-year semesters, or have been in the doctoral program for five or more years, will have a reduced priority for support.

## 5. Changing from GTA to GRA

A student may give up a GTA in favor of a GRA up to two weeks (14 days) before the start of semester classes. Beyond that point in time a GTA may be vacated in favor of a GRA only with the consent of the instructor of the course to which the GTA is assigned and the department head. In the event of a GTA to GRA change, the instructor of the course will work with the GPC to determine the replacement.

## 6. Academic Eligibility

A student must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better for all courses taken while in graduate school at Virginia Tech and for all courses transferred for graduate credit at Virginia Tech. At the end of each semester the GPC reviews the progress of each ISE graduate student. Any student with a cumulative grade point average below 3.0 for their last semester of graduate work will be placed on academic probation and may be required to appear before this committee. The purpose of this appearance is to discover the source of the difficulties evidenced by unsatisfactory progress and to outline avenues that the student should pursue to improve their performance. In accordance with Graduate School and ISE departmental policy, any student who fails to meet these requirements in two successive semesters will typically be dismissed from the ISE graduate program.

## 7. Graduate Honor System

Academic integrity is essential for maintaining the quality of scholarship in the department and for protecting those who depend on the results of research work performed by faculty and students in the department. The faculty of the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering expects all students to maintain academic integrity at all times in the classroom and the research laboratory and to conduct their academic work in accordance with the high ethical standards of the engineering profession.

Students are expected to maintain academic integrity by refraining from academic dishonesty, and conduct that aids others in academic dishonesty or that leads to suspicion of academic dishonesty. Violations of academic integrity will result in disciplinary actions ranging from failing grades on assignments and courses to probation, suspension, or dismissal from the university.

The Graduate Honor Code establishes a standard of academic integrity. As such, this code demands a firm adherence to a set of values. In particular, the code is founded on the concept of honesty with respect to the intellectual efforts of oneself and others. Compliance with the Graduate Honor Code requires that all graduate students exercise honesty and ethical behavior in all their academic pursuits at Virginia Tech, whether these undertakings pertain to study, course work, research, extension, or teaching. Details on the Graduate Honor Code can be found at the following Virginia Tech website: http://ghs.graduateschool.vt.edu/

It is recognized that graduate student population is very culturally diverse. In light of this, the term ethical behavior is defined as conforming to accepted professional standards of conduct, such as codes of ethics used by professional societies in the United States to regulate the manner in which their professions are practiced. The knowledge and practice of ethical behavior shall be the full responsibility of the student. Graduate students may, however, consult with their advisors, department heads, the Cranwell International Center, or the Graduate School for further information on what is expected of them.

More specifically, all graduate students, while being affiliated with Virginia Tech, shall abide by the standards established by Virginia Tech, as these are described in the Graduate Honor System Constitution. Graduate students, in accepting admission, indicate their willingness to subscribe to and be governed by the Graduate Honor Code and acknowledge the right of the university to establish policies and procedures and to take disciplinary action (including suspension or expulsion) when such action is warranted. Ignorance shall be no excuse for actions that violate the integrity of the academic community.

## 8. Graduate Program Advising

M.S. and Ph.D. students are primarily advised by their faculty research advisor. M.Eng. students are advised by both the Graduate Program Director and the Graduate Program Advisor. M.E.A students are advised by the M.E.A. Director and Systems Engineering students are advised by the SYSE Director. All graduate students will be added to the ISE Graduate Advising Canvas site upon enrollment in any ISE graduate program. This site provides pages for all things related to the ISE graduate program. If you are enrolled in an ISE graduate program and are unable to access the site, contact the ISE Graduate Advisor.

# GRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS

Students pursuing a graduate degree in the ISE Department must satisfy the requirements of the Graduate School, the ISE Department, and those specific to the student’s degree program. For a discussion of general Graduate School requirements, the student should consult the Graduate Catalog (https://secure.graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_catalog). Listed here are the requirements within ISE and those for each of the different degree programs. It is the responsibility of each student to know these requirements; students should consult with their faculty advisor, the ISE Graduate Advisor, or the ISE Graduate Program Director (GPD) to address any questions or concerns.

## 1. Plan of Study (all degree programs)

After identifying a graduate advisor (and graduate committee, if required), students need to prepare their plan of study in consultation with their advisor. The plan of study summarizes completed and planned coursework and the student’s advisors. Courses listed on the plan of study must include, but are not limited to, all courses required for the degree being pursued. A plan of study is required of all students pursuing graduate degrees at Virginia Tech and contains the elements below:

A. List of courses to be completed for degree completion, including the semester and year in which each course has or will be taken.

B. The names and signatures of each member of the student’s graduate advisory committee.

Graduate school policies indicate the following:

- For students pursuing the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), Master of Science (M.S.), Master of Engineering Administration (M.E.A.), or Master of Systems Engineering (M.S.), degrees, the plan of study must be completed and submitted prior to the completion of 24 credit hours or by the end of their second semester of full-time enrollment in their graduate program.
- For students pursuing a Ph.D., the plan of study must be submitted prior to the completion of 36

credit hours or by the end of their third semester of full-time enrollment in their graduate program.

However, the ISE Department expects all graduate students to submit their plan of study prior to completing their second semester in the program. The department expects this early submission, so that students ensure they are taking relevant foundational coursework and do not miss courses that are not offered yearly (i.e., only every two or three years). Early completion of the plan of study is particularly important for M.S. and Ph.D. students, since doing so will allow them to start their research soon and ensure that the remaining program milestones are completed in a timely fashion.

All ISE graduate students must also take ISE 5024: ISE Seminar. This seminar must be taken during the first Fall semester of enrollment in the graduate program (it is offered only in the Fall term) and it focuses on the ISE graduate program, ethics and integrity, faculty, and faculty research areas.

The Graduate School has rules on transfer credit. Students should consult the Graduate Catalog for these rules (https://secure.graduateschool.vt.edu/graduate_catalog/policies.htm). The ISE Department also has rules on transfer credit (beyond the Graduate School rules): transfer courses may not exceed one-half of graded course credit hours on a plan of study and must be graduate course hours earned at an accredited institution. All transfer courses must have a grade of B or better to be considered for transfer credit. When appropriate, these transfer credits can be used to substitute for required courses if approved by theㅊappropriate course instructor, graduate advisor, and the ISE GPD. In all cases, transfer credits on the plan of study must be approved by the student’s advisory committee.

Students who have completed a Master’s degree at another university may be required to take Master’s level courses in those areas where deficiencies are identified. Where such deficiencies are identified, the student’s advisory committee will recommend appropriate courses to be included in the plan of study and taken by the student prior to degree completion. Normally, but not in all cases, such courses will carry graduate credit.

The plan of study approval process includes review and signed approval by the student’s advisor, graduate committee members, and GPD. The plan of study is submitted to the ISE Graduate Program Advisor for electronic entry and approval by the Graduate School.

## 2. Requirements for Specific Degree Programs

Additional details on the requirements for each of the five different ISE degree programs. are given in separate sections below. Students should ensure that they follow the requirements that are appropriate for their specific degree program. Note that the expected timelines provided are for full-time students, and it is recognized that others will required addition time (e.g., part-time students or those who have taken leaves-of-absence).

### 2.1 Master of Engineering in ISE (M.Eng.)

An overview of the requirements and the expected timeline is given in the figure below.

Plan of Study (Year 1): Graduate Advisor, Courses -> Final Examination (Year 2)

#### Plan of Study

The first step in defining the plan of study is the selection of a graduate advisor. M.Eng. students are advised by the ISE GPD (with additional assistance from the ISE Graduate Program Advisor). M.Eng. students do not need a formal advisory committee, other than the ISE GPD.

#### Final Examination

All graduate students pursuing a M.Eng. degree are required to schedule a final examination. The examination is also a requirement of the Graduate School and must be administered during a semester in which the student is registered. There is no formal deliverable or activity for the M.Eng. final examination. Note that the ISE Department expects M.Eng. students to complete the program within two years after enrolling in the M.Eng. program.

Graduate School policy states: “Requests to schedule final examinations must include the time, date, building and room number, title of dissertation or thesis, and the names and email addresses of the Examining Committee. These requests are due in the Graduate School at least two weeks before the examination date requested.”

Students should contact the Graduate School at least two days prior to a requested examination/evaluation date if they have not received the official notification of scheduling.

Graduate School policies on scheduling examinations/evaluations can be found in the Virginia Tech Graduate Catalog.

The exam is scheduled online using the Graduate School’s electronic scheduling and signature system (ESS). M.Eng. students will use the first business day following the deadline for final grade entry in the semester they are completing their degree.

### 2.2 Master of Science in ISE (M.S.)

An overview of the requirements and the expected timeline is given in the figure below.

- Plan of Study (Year 1): Advisory Committee, Graduate Advisor, Courses
- Proposal (Year 1): Written Proposal, Oral Exam
- Progress Meeting (Year 2): Research Progress, Necessary Changes
- Final Defense (Year 2): Thesis/Dissertation, Oral Exam

#### Assessment

All M.S. in ISE students will be assessed at various milestones during their degree by their advisory committee.

M.S. in ISE Assessment:

- Research Proposal Meeting
- Final Thesis Defense

The assessment rubric for each milestone can be found on the ISE Graduate Advising Canvas site, on the M.S. and Ph.D. Assessment page so that you know what the expectations are. Your advisory committee can access the assessment survey on the ISE HUB.

#### Plan of Study

Graduate Advisor: The first step in defining the plan of study is the selection of a graduate advisor. New M.S. students are assigned a temporary faculty advisor in their general area of interest. The student, however, should begin working early to determine an appropriate research advisor (or co- advisors). A student’s advisor or co-advisor must be a member of the ISE tenured/tenure track faculty, or an ISE Affiliate Faculty, and should have expertise in the research area(s) the student intends to pursue. In all cases, the faculty member must give their written consent to serve in the capacity of graduate advisor.

Advisory Committee: A graduate advisory committee is required for all M.S. students. The graduate advisor serves as the chair of the graduate advisory committee and the student should seek the assistance of their advisor in identifying faculty who might serve on the committee. The committee should be composed of faculty members who can assist the student in completing their graduate degree. To facilitate such assistance, the student is encouraged to send a brief summary of their future research interest(s) to potential committee members for their review. Each member is added to the student’s committee after consenting to serve.

Committee Requirements: M.S. advisory committees must include a minimum of three members, at least two of which must be Virginia Tech tenured/tenure-track faculty (per Graduate School requirements, or at least 2/3 if there are more than four members). An additional departmental-level requirement is that at least two of the members must be ISE tenured/tenure-track faculty (this counts as part of the 2/3 Graduate School requirement). Having a member outside of the ISE Department or even outside of Virginia Tech is encouraged, but not required.

Committee Meetings: Committee members are expected to attend meetings as a collective body, and the student’s advisor(s) must be present at all such meetings. Faculty participation on graduate student committees is an important part of ISE faculty responsibilities. To this end, ISE faculty are expected to attend all committee meetings for graduate students they advise or on whose committees they serve. In addition, university policies require that all committee members attend a student’s final thesis defense.

ISE M.S. students are required to sequentially complete several milestones and to meet periodically with their graduate advisory committee. These milestones and associated committee meetings are listed below, though additional meetings can be held as needed. As noted earlier (see “Advisory Committee”), committee members are expected to attend all required meetings except in unusual circumstances.

- Research Proposal
- Progress Report
- Final Defense

A note regarding ISE Policy: Students, or anyone on their behalf, are strictly forbidden from bringing food or drink to student evaluation meetings (e.g., graduate student progress meetings, proposal defenses, final defenses).

#### Research Proposal

Students pursuing an M.S. degree are required to complete research during their graduate study. The ISE Department expects the M.S. proposal to be defended successfully before the end of the

student’s first summer in the graduate program. Further, it is expected that the M.S. research will be proposed to the committee before substantial aspects of the research are completed. The student is required to prepare a written research proposal that describes the background and motivation for the research, the specific content of the research, the outcomes anticipated, the contributions to the field of endeavor, and the creative content of the effort. The written proposal does not have any required format, though many students model it on what is required by major funding agencies (e.g., NIH or NSF). The written proposal must be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to a meeting with the advisory committee. At this meeting, the proposal will be presented by the student and evaluated by the committee, which will provide constructive feedback. Signatures of each committee member on the proposal approval form signify approval of the proposed research effort. This form must be submitted to the ISE Graduate Program Advisor upon completion. The nature and extent of the proposed research effort depend on the degree sought. The results of M.S. research are typically equivalent to one or two journal publications.

#### Progress Meeting

Between the research proposal and the final examination, each student is required to provide a summary of progress to their advisory committee at a progress meeting. This meeting is expected to be held before the M.S. research is completed, typically at the start of the second year of the student’s graduate program. A major purpose of the progress meeting is for the student to update the advisory committee on any achievements or problems. that have arisen during their research. If non- trivial changes are needed from what was presented in the proposal, these changes should be explained in detail and approved by the advisory committee. Students often give a brief presentation at this meeting. The advisory committee must sign the progress report form, and this form is submitted to the ISE Graduate Program Advisor upon completion.

#### Final Defense

All graduate students pursuing an M.S. degree are required to pass a final examination or defense. This is an oral examination, administered by the advisory committee. The examination is also a requirement of the Graduate School and must be administered during a semester in which the student is registered. Note that the ISE Department expects M.S. students to defend their dissertation successfully within two years after enrolling in the M.S. program. The department requires that the written thesis be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to the oral examination.

The ISE Department requires all M.S. final defenses to be open, including the Question & Answer portion of the exam. Final defenses must be advertised in advance to ISE faculty and graduate students. Once the exam date, time, and location are scheduled, students should send the information to the ISE Graduate Program Advisor, along with an abstract of their thesis or dissertation. Exceptions to open defenses will be made for relevant situations and should be submitted to the ISE GPD at least two weeks prior to the scheduled defense. Exceptions can be full (no portion open) or partial. Some examples for exceptions are proprietary, confidential, or export control materials.

Graduate School policy states: “Requests to schedule final examinations must include the time, date, building and room number, title of dissertation or thesis, and the names and email addresses of the Examining Committee. These requests are due in the Graduate School at least two weeks before the examination date requested.” As a reminder, the thesis document must be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to the oral defense.

Approval of a final examination request indicates that the committee member has received and read the thesis or dissertation document and agrees that the document is ready for defense. This means that no substantial additional work or changes are needed, and that only minor edits to the document will be necessary after the defense.

As a reminder, no examination or evaluation should be conducted if the committee has not received electronic notification from the Graduate School that the examination/evaluation has been officially scheduled. Students should contact the Graduate School at least two days prior to a requested examination/evaluation date if they have not received the official notification of scheduling.

Graduate School policies on scheduling examinations/evaluations can be found in the Virginia Tech Graduate Catalog.

The exam is scheduled online using the Graduate School’s electronic scheduling and signature system
(ESS).

To pass the final examination, a degree candidate must have a favorable vote from a majority of the examining committee, with a maximum of one negative vote. If a student fails the final examination, there must be a lapse of one full semester (15 weeks) before rescheduling the examination. A student is allowed no more than two opportunities to pass the final examination.

The result of the examination is recorded in the ESS system. Each member of the student’s advisory committee must approve the exam result in the ESS system. After a successful oral defense, the student has two weeks to revise the thesis to address any suggestions or concerns expressed by the committee.

### 2.3 Master of Engineering Administration (M.E.A.)

An overview of the requirements and the expected timeline is given in the figure below.

Plan of Study (Year 1): Graduate Advisor, Courses -> Final Examination (Year 2)

#### Plan of Study

The first step in defining the plan of study is the selection of a graduate advisor. M.E.A. students are advised by the Director of the M.E.A. program, and two additional members are appointed by the ISE Department Head as the M.E.A. Advisory Committee

#### Final Examination

All graduate students pursuing an M.E.A. degree are required to schedule a final examination. The examination is also a requirement of the Graduate School and must be administered during a semester in which the student is registered. The M.E.A. final exam is the M.E.A. comprehensive exam, which students complete in their final semester in the program. The advisory committee role is to verify that the student has completed their course requirements and the comprehensive exam.

Graduate School policy states: “Requests to schedule final examinations must include the time, date, building and room number, title of dissertation or thesis, and the names and email addresses of the Examining Committee. These requests are due in the Graduate School at least two weeks before the examination date requested.”

The Director of the M.E.A. program will notify students who are in their final semester of the date, time, and location of the M.E.A. comprehensive exam.

No examination or evaluation should be conducted if the committee has not received electronic notification from the Graduate School that the examination/evaluation has been officially scheduled. Students should contact the Graduate School at least two days prior to a requested examination/evaluation date if they have not received the official notification of scheduling.

Graduate School policies on scheduling examinations/evaluations can be found in the Virginia Tech Graduate Catalog.

The exam is scheduled online using the Graduate School’s electronic scheduling and signature system (ESS). M.E.A. students will use the date that they take the M.E.A. comprehensive exam.

### 2.4 Master of Science in System Engineering (M.S.)

An overview of the requirements and the expected timeline is given in the figure below.

Plan of Study (Year 1): Graduate Advisor, Courses -> Final Examination (Year 2)

#### Plan of Study

The first step in defining the plan of study is the selection of a graduate advisor. SYSE students are advised by the Director of the SYSE program, and two additional members are appointed by the ISE Department Head as the SYSE Advisory Committee

#### Final Examination

All graduate students pursuing a SYSE degree are required to schedule a final examination. The examination is also a requirement of the Graduate School and must be administered during a semester in which the student is registered. The final exam for the M.S. in SYSE is conducted in ENGR 5204 (Systems Engineering Projects), in which students present their final project of the semester. The advisory committee role is to verify that the student has completed their course requirements and the final project.

Graduate School policy states: “Requests to schedule final examinations must include the time, date, building and room number, title of dissertation or thesis, and the names and email addresses of the Examining Committee. These requests are due in the Graduate School at least two weeks before the examination date requested.”

No examination or evaluation should be conducted if the committee has not received electronic notification from the Graduate School that the examination/evaluation has been officially scheduled. Students should contact the Graduate School at least two days prior to a requested examination/evaluation date if they have not received the official notification of scheduling.

Graduate School policies on scheduling examinations/evaluations can be found in the Virginia Tech Graduate Catalog.

The exam is scheduled online using the Graduate School’s electronic scheduling and signature system (ESS). SYSE students will use the date of the final project presentation sin ENGR 5204.

### 2.5 Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)

An overview of the requirements and the expected timeline is given in the figure below.

- Plan of Study (Year 1): Advisory Committee, Graduate Advisor, Courses
- Preliminary Exam (Year 2-3): Select Option, Written Deliverable, Oral Exam
- Proposal (Year 3): Written Proposal, Oral Exam
- Progress Meeting (Year 3-4): Research Progress, Necessary Changes
- Final Defense (Year 4): Thesis/Dissertation, Oral Exam

#### Assessment

All Ph.D. students will be assessed at various milestones during their degree by their advisory committee.

Ph.D. Assessment:

- Preliminary Exam
- Research Proposal Meeting
- Final Dissertation Defense

The assessment rubric for each milestone can be found on the ISE Graduate Advising Canvas site on the M.S. and Ph.D. Assessment page so that you know what the expectations are. Your advisory committee can access the assessment survey on the ISE HUB.

#### Plan of Study

Graduate Advisor: The first step in defining the plan of study is the selection of a graduate advisor. New Ph.D. students are assigned a temporary faculty advisor in their general area of interest. The student, however, should begin working early to determine an appropriate research advisor.

To facilitate such assistance, the student is encouraged to send a brief summary of their future research interest(s) to potential committee members for their review. Each member is added to the student’s committee after consenting to serve.

Committee Requirements: Ph.D. advisory committees must include a minimum of four members, at least three of which must be Virginia Tech tenured/tenure-track faculty (per Graduate School requirements, or at least 2/3 if there are more than four members). An additional departmental-level requirement is that at least two of the members must be ISE tenured/tenure-track faculty (this counts as part of the Graduate School requirement). Having a member outside of the ISE Department or even outside of Virginia Tech is encouraged, but not required.

Committee Meetings: Committee members are expected to attend meetings as a collective body, and the student’s advisor(s) must be present at all such meetings.

As noted earlier (see “Advisory Committee”), committee members are expected to attend all required meetings except in unusual circumstances.

- Preliminary examination
- Research Proposal
- Progress Report
- Final Defense

A note regarding ISE Policy: Students, or anyone on their behalf, are strictly forbidden from bringing food or drink to student evaluation meetings (e.g., graduate student progress meetings, proposal defenses, prelim defenses, final defenses).

#### Preliminary Examination

The oral portion of the preliminary examination is a requirement of the Graduate School and must be successfully completed by all Ph.D. students. The Graduate School requires this to be completed at least six months prior to completing the Ph.D. degree (final defense of the dissertation). The ISE Department expects the Preliminary Examination to be completed before the end of a student’s fourth or at the start of their fifth semester in the Ph.D. program. Prior to starting the Preliminary Exam, it is expected that the student will complete all (or the vast majority) of their coursework and have identified fairly specific areas of research interest for their Dissertation.

The ISE Preliminary Exam has the primary purpose of evaluating the extent to which Ph.D. students are prepared to pursue independent research at a level expected in the department. This examination includes both written and oral parts; it is used to identify any weaknesses or gaps in the student’s abilities, skills, and knowledge; and the primary outcome of this exam is an appropriate plan to address any identified weaknesses or gaps. This examination is an essential demonstration of the likelihood that a student will complete their Ph.D. successfully. Thus, the ISE faculty consider this examination to be a major milestone and decision point for both students and faculty regarding the appropriateness of a student continuing in the program.

Since Ph.D. students come from diverse academic backgrounds and progress through the program differently, several options are available to complete this examination as described below. For each option, a deliverable must be submitted at least two weeks prior to a pre-scheduled, two-hour oral examination with the committee, in which the discussion will focus on the student’s deliverable and any other topics determined to be of relevance by the committee.

Students must confer with committee members prior to selecting one of the specific options described below, and the student must have approval from all committee members regarding the option selected. Regardless of the option used to complete the exam, the deliverable to the committee must represent substantially independent work completed by the student. Ideally, the preliminary examination is to be solely the work of the student, although input from the advisor or committee in the form of general mentoring or guidance is fully acceptable. Use of proofreaders or writing assistance is not acceptable, and to do otherwise is considered a violation of the honor code.

When submitting the required deliverable for any of the four options, the student must indicate what, if any, assistance was received in creating the deliverable.

For options 2, 3, and 4, the topic may be determined by the student; in these cases, the topic needs to be approved in advance by the committee. Such approval can be obtained in a meeting or via individual discussions. Alternatively, the topic can be suggested by the committee. Deliverables for these same options must represent work done since starting the Ph.D. program at VT. Any material provided in these deliverables may be used by the student in subsequent program milestones without limitation.

- Written Examination: The student will respond to written questions posed by the advisory committee. Questions can cover any aspect of ISE study desired by the advisory committee, though these are often focused on the student’s area(s) of research interest. Students are therefore strongly encouraged to submit the brief description of their research interests, noted above, to the advisory committee, and to do so well before the examination. Students will have two weeks after receiving questions to provide written responses to the advisory committee questions and may not receive any assistance with their written responses.
- Research Paper: The student will submit to the committee a paper that represents a completed research effort. This effort should represent original work led by the student and should be prepared in a format and with a writing style appropriate for a leading peer-reviewed journal in their research area.
- Review Paper: The student will submit to the committee a critical review of the literature in a research area, which summarizes the current state of knowledge and associated limitations or future needs. This effort should represent original work led by the student and should be prepared in a format and with a writing style appropriate for a leading peer-reviewed journal in their research area.
- Proposal for a Research Effort: The student will submit to the committee a written proposal for a research effort, the scope of which should be roughly equivalent to one publication in a peer-reviewed journal in their research area. It will be acceptable for the student to include this material as a portion of their subsequent dissertation proposal. The proposal should include clear motivation for the proposed work, a critical review of relevant literature, and a detailed research plan.

The oral portion of the examination is administered at least two weeks after completion of the written portion and must be scheduled through the Graduate School. Students must be enrolled during the semester the oral portion of the examination is taken and may not schedule the preliminary examination until they have a plan of study that has received final approval from the Graduate School. The oral preliminary examination must be scheduled through the Graduate School at least two weeks prior to the date the exam will be held. The exam is scheduled online using the Graduate School’s electronic scheduling and signature system (ESS).

Graduate School policy states: “Requests to schedule examinations must include the time, date, building and room number, title of dissertation or thesis, and the names and email addresses of the Examining Committee. These requests are due in the Graduate School at least two weeks before the examination date requested.”

As a reminder, no examination or evaluation should be conducted if the committee has not received electronic notification from the Graduate School that the examination/evaluation has been officially scheduled. Students should contact the Graduate School at least two days prior to a requested examination/evaluation date if they have not received the official notification of scheduling.

Graduate School policies on scheduling examinations/evaluations can be found in the Virginia Tech Graduate Catalog.

The student’s advisor administers the oral portion of the preliminary examination. This examination should be closed to outside members. One negative vote by a committee member is permitted for successful completion of the examination. If performance on the preliminary examination is unsatisfactory, one full semester must lapse (15 weeks) before the examination is administered a second time. Students failing the preliminary examination twice will be dismissed from the program. The result of the examination is recorded in the ESS system. Each member of the student’s advisory committee must approve the exam result in the ESS system. Advisory committees reserve the right to alter a plan of study based on performance on the preliminary exam.

#### Research Proposal

Students pursuing a Ph.D. degree are required to complete research during their graduate studies. The ISE Department expects the Ph.D. proposal to be defended successfully before the end of the student’s third year in the graduate program. Further, it is expected that the Ph.D. research will be proposed to the committee before substantial aspects of the research are completed. The student is required to prepare a written research proposal that describes the background and motivation for the research, the specific content of the research, the outcomes anticipated, the contributions to the field of endeavor, and the creative content of the effort. The written proposal does not have any required format, though many students model it on what is required by major funding agencies (e.g., NIH or NSF). The written proposal must be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to a meeting with the advisory committee. At this meeting, the proposal will be presented by the student and evaluated by the committee, which will provide constructive feedback. Signatures of each committee member on the proposal approval form signify approval of the proposed research effort. This form must be submitted to the ISE Graduate Program Advisor upon completion.

The nature and extent of the proposed research effort depend on the degree sought. A student pursuing a Ph.D. degree should demonstrate, through the dissertation, the ability to carry out original and creative research. The results of Ph.D. research are typically equivalent to three or more journal publications.

#### Progress Meeting

Between the research proposal and the final examination, each student is required to provide a summary of progress to their advisory committee at a progress meeting. This meeting is expected to be held before the Ph.D. research is completed, typically at the end of the third year or the start of the fourth year of the student’s graduate program. A major purpose of the progress meeting is for the student to update the advisory committee on any achievements or problems. that have arisen during their research. If non-trivial changes are needed, from what was presented in the proposal, these changes should be explained in detail and approved by the advisory committee. Students often give a brief presentation at this meeting. The advisory committee must sign the progress report form, and this form is submitted to the ISE Graduate Program Advisor upon completion.

#### Final Defense

All graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. degree are required to pass a final examination or defense. This is an oral examination, administered by the advisory committee. The examination is also a requirement of the Graduate School and must be administered during a semester in which the student is registered. Note that the ISE Department expects Ph.D. students to defend their dissertation successfully within four years after enrolling in the Ph.D. program. The department requires that the written dissertation be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to the oral examination. There is no requirement for the student to have an accepted or submitted journal paper from their dissertation work, prior to the final defense. Submitting and publishing papers from the research is, however, strongly encouraged at any time during the program.

The ISE Department requires all Ph.D. final defenses to be open, including the Question & Answer portion of the exam. Final defenses must be advertised in advance to ISE faculty and graduate students. Once the exam date, time, and location are scheduled, students should send the information to the ISE Graduate Program Advisor, along with an abstract of their thesis or dissertation, at least 48 hours in advance of the exam. Exceptions to open defenses will be made for relevant situations and should be submitted to the ISE GPD at least two weeks prior to the scheduled defense. Exceptions can be full (no portion open) or partial. Some examples for exceptions are proprietary, confidential, or export control materials.

Graduate School policy states: “Requests to schedule final examinations must include the time, date, building and room number, title of dissertation or thesis, and the names and email addresses of the Examining Committee. These requests are due in the Graduate School at least two weeks before the examination date requested.” As a reminder, the dissertation document must be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to the oral defense.

Approval of a final examination request indicates that the committee member has received and read the thesis or dissertation document and agrees that the document is ready for defense. This means that no substantial additional work or changes are likely needed, and that only minor edits to the document will be necessary after the defense.

As a reminder, no examination or evaluation should be conducted if the committee has not received electronic notification from the Graduate School that the examination/evaluation has been officially scheduled. Students should contact the Graduate School at least two days prior to a requested examination/evaluation date if they have not received the official notification of scheduling.

Graduate School policies on scheduling examinations/evaluations can be found in the Virginia Tech Graduate Catalog.

The exam is scheduled online using the Graduate School’s electronic scheduling and signature system
(ESS).

To pass the final examination, a degree candidate must have a favorable vote from a majority of the examining committee, with a maximum of one negative vote. If a student fails the final examination, there must be a lapse of one full semester (15 weeks) before rescheduling the examination. A student is allowed no more than two opportunities to pass the final examination.

The result of the examination is recorded in the ESS system. Each member of the student’s advisory committee must approve the exam result in the ESS system. After a successful oral defense, the

student has two weeks to revise the dissertation to address any suggestions or concerns expressed by the committee.

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions (and answers)

### 3.1 Should I pursue the ISE thesis (M.S.) or non-thesis (M.Eng.) Master’s?

This is a common question among Master’s students. Each area of study may have a different focus in this regard; however, there are some general issues students should consider.

Thesis Advantages: A thesis provides a formal experience with research and good preparation for pursuit of a Ph.D. (application reviewers may see this experience as a positive if a student applies for a Ph.D. program). A thesis may also be valued by future employers, depending on the field of study. Note that students who pursue an M.S. degree are required to take three fewer courses than those pursuing a M.Eng.

Thesis Disadvantages: Students will generally invest at least one summer working on their research, as well as substantial time during the academic year.

### 3.2 What are the faculty expectations for the Preliminary Exam, Proposal Defense, and Final Defense?

Students working on the M.S. or Ph.D. are evaluated at these major program milestones using a shared rubric. A copy of this rubric is available to students on a Canvas site for ISE graduate students. Major areas of evaluation include the following (not all areas will be relevant for all students at all milestones):

- Knowledge of and ability to critique the body of knowledge related to the area(s) of research.
- Ability to properly use methods, or develop new methods, as relevant to the area(s) of research and proposed research topic(s).
- Creativity and originality in formulating a research plan.
- Ability to articulate the significance of the research (plan).
- Ability to present the technical and broader societal impacts and implications of the research (plan).
- Written communication skills (including organization, flow, writing quality, level of detail and completeness, and data presentation).
- Oral communication skills (including organization, flow, speaking quality, use of media, and responses to questions).
- Ability to perform future independent research.

## 4. Continuing from the M.S. to the Ph.D.

Students in the Master’s program who wish to continue in the ISE department to pursue a Ph.D. degree need to formally apply to the Ph.D. program (i.e., by submitting an application to the Graduate School). The ISE Graduate Admissions Committee will review the student’s academic performance, and a decision on admission to the Ph.D. program will be made upon completion of the review. If accepted, the student will be officially notified by the Graduate School.
